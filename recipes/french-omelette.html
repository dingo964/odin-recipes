    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French omelettes are cooked <strong>just until set</strong>, so they have a creamy, <em>custard-like</em> texture and no brown spots outside.
     They are rarely filled with anything other than a small amount of cheese, and they're rolled into a log rather than folded in half for serving.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Eggs</li>

      <li>Butter</li>

      <li>Herbs</li>

      <li>Salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

      <li>Melt the butter in the skillet, then add the beaten eggs.</li>

      <li>Gently loosen the omelette from the skillet, then fold and roll it into a log. </li>

      <li>Plate, butter the top, and scatter salt and herbs over the top. ENJOY!</li>
