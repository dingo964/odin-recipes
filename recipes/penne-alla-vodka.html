    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made primarily with vodka and penne pasta (or similar shapes such as rigatoni), 
      usually accompanied with <strong>heavy cream, crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, onions, and sometimes small meats and vegetables like sausage, pancetta or peas</strong>. 
      The alcohol apparently helps <em>intensify and accentuate</em> flavors in the dish, among other claims.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    
      <li>Tubed pasta</li>

      <li>Butter</li>

      <li>Tomato Paste</li>

      <li>Heavy cream</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
    
      <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
      
      <li>Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until paste has coated shallots and garlic and is beginning to darken, 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Add vodka to pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn off heat.</li>

      <li>Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta. Serve topped with more Parmesan and torn basil leaves.</li>
