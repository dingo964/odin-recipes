    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French omelettes are cooked just until set, so they have a creamy, custard-like texture and no brown spots outside.
    They are rarely filled with anything other than a small amount of cheese, and theyâ€™re rolled into a log rather than folded in half for serving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    
      <li>Tubed pasta</li>

      <li>Butter</li>

      <li>Tomato Paste</li>

      <li>Vodka</li>

      <li>Heavy cream</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
    
      <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
      
      <li>Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until paste has coated shallots and garlic and is beginning to darken, 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Add vodka to pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn off heat.</li>

      <li>Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta. Serve topped with more Parmesan and torn basil leaves.</li>

    </ol>
