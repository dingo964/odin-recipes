    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French omelettes are cooked just until set, so they have a creamy, custard-like texture and no brown spots outside.
       They are rarely filled with anything other than a small amount of cheese, and they're rolled into a log rather than folded in half for serving.</p>
